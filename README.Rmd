# bcgovr

An [R](http://r-project.org) package to support development of R-based projects and packages following [bcgov guidelines and policies](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub).

### Features

Currently there are two main functions for auto-populating a new R-based data analysis or package project directory:

- `analysis_skeleton()` # starting a new data analysis project
- `package_skeleton()` # starting a new R package

The package also installs two [RStudio Addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) for adding:
(1) the [boiler-plate Apache 2.0 license header](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Licenses.md) into the comments header of every source code file.
(2) a [BCDevExchange project state badge](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/Our-Project-Docs/blob/master/discussion/projectstates.md) to a README file.


### Installation

You can install the package directly from this repository. To do so, you will 
need the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
```

Next, install the `bcgovr` package using `devtools::install_github()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("bcgov/bcgovr")
```


### Usage
Auto-populate a new R-based data analysis or package project directory, including all of the [required bcgov items](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md), with `analysis_skeleton` or `package_skeleton`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(bcgovr)
analysis_skeleton(path = ".") # path = location to create new analysis. If path = "." the name of 
                              # the working directory will be taken as the analysis name. 
```

Resulting in a [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov) 'ready-to-go' directory for a new data analysis project:

Using RStudio and need to add that Apache 2.0 license header in new .R file? Just click twice:
