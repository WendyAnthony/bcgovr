# bcgovr

An [R](http://r-project.org) package to support development of R-based projects and packages following [bcgov open source guidelines and policies](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub).

---

### Features

Currently there are two main functions for auto-populating a new R-based data analysis or package project directory:

- `analysis_skeleton()` # starting a new data analysis project
- `package_skeleton()` # starting a new R package

The package also installs two [RStudio Addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) for adding:

1. The [boiler-plate Apache 2.0 license header](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Open-Source-Development-Employee-Guide/Licenses.md) into the comments header of every source code file.
2. A [BCDevExchange project state badge](https://github.com/BCDevExchange/Our-Project-Docs/blob/master/discussion/projectstates.md) to a README file.

---

### Installation

If you have not already installed R itself or RStudio on a BC Government computer, you can follow these [installation instructions](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgovr/blob/master/Install_Instructions.md) to get set up using R. 

Once you have R and RStudio installed on your machine, open up RStudio so you can install the `bcgovr` package directly from this repository. To do so, you will 
first need the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/) package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Next, install the `bcgovr` package using `devtools::install_github()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bcgov/bcgovr")
```

---

### Usage

#### analysis_skeleton()
Most first time users will want to start with the `analysis_skeleton()` function. If RStudio is still open from the above [Installation] steps, you can now immediately auto-populate a new R-based open source data analysis project folder, including all of the [required bcgov items](https://github.com/bcgov/BC-Policy-Framework-For-GitHub/blob/master/BC-Gov-Org-HowTo/Cheatsheet.md), with `analysis_skeleton`. You can use `bcgovr::analysis_skeleton()` which directly calls the function from `bcgovr` library rather than loading the entire library. By default `analysis_skeleton()` will create a 'ready-to-go' directory in the current working directory. You can check the working directory using `getwd()`. The project name will be inherited from the working directory:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bcgovr::analysis_skeleton() 
```

Frequently you may want to create an analysis skeleton outside of the working directory. This directory can be set using the `path` argument. Consider if you wanted to create an analysis skeleton named `bcgovr_analysis` in the `C:/_dev` directory. In this case, you would directly input the path which would also automatically create a `bcgovr_analysis` folder if it did not exist already:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bcgovr::analysis_skeleton(path = "C:\_dev\bcgovr_analysis") 
```

Regardless of the path, ultimately, `analysis_skeleton()` results in a [bcgov](https://github.com/bcgov) 'ready-to-go' directory for a new data analysis project:

##### Options

* **Code of Conduct contact email address:** To avoid having to always edit your Codes of Conduct to add contact email addresses you can add this line to your `.Rprofile` file:

```r
if (interactive()) options("bcgovr.coc_email" = "my.email@gov.bc.ca")
```


#### package_skeleton()
The `package_skeleton()` function is used the same way as `analysis_skeleton()` but will create all the files and folders to get started on creating an R package. The [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) book by Hadley Wickham is an incredible resource if you are looking to create packages.


#### RStudio Addins

Using RStudio and need to add that Apache 2.0 license header in new .R file or project state badge? Just click twice:

### Setting up a github repo with `bcgovr`

`bcgovr` can also be used as part of sequence to set up a repository on the [BC Government github space](https://github.com/bcgov).

Simply follow the steps below:

1. At github.com/bcgov, click on the green "New" button to create a new repository.

  * Note: create an empty repo, without initializing with a README, and without a .gitignore file or a license. `bcgovr` will take care of that for you.
  
  * Copy the URL of the repo; you'll need it in step #2.
  
2. In RStudio, open a new project.

  * <File/New Project>, <Version Control>, <Git>
  
  * paste in the URL of the new repo you created in step #1.
  
3. RStudio: set the working directory to the project directory

  * <Session>, <Set Working Directory>, <To Project Directory>
  
4. Run either the analysis or package skeleton

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bcgovr::analysis_skeleton() 
```
  
5. Open project file (with ".Rproj" extension)

6. Commit, push, and pull as you would normally
